# Low-cost Acoustic Underwater Communication System

This project focuses on developing a low-cost acoustic communication system for underwater applications. The system is designed to transmit and receive data acoustically between two fixed nodes.

## Key Features
- **Modulation Technique:** QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying)
- **Microcontroller:** Nucleo-F411RE
- **Ultrasonic Transducers:** CUSA-TR65-065-2200-WC68
- **Operational Amplifiers:** OPA552 and TLV2316
